# Way of thinking:

The field of " information security" is massive. It would be impossible for any one person to learn everything.
example:
<p style='background-color:rgb(60, 49, 118) ; color:white ; padding:10px ; text-align:justify'>
	Imagine you want to become a programmer, and you know that there are more than 200 different programming languages that can be used to create applications that can be cracked by debugging or reverse engineering. If we learned every programming language within 100 hours, we would spend 20,000 hours or 2,500 days (8 hours per day) or, in other words, almost seven years to learn all of these programming languages. As a result, we spent seven years learning all these languages and never tried to debug or reverse engineer the program we created. Great! Let us spend another seven years learning to debug and reverse engineering.
</p>
Every programming language has its own strengths and weaknesses. Also, if we can obtain a deep understanding of a single programming language, we will learn others much faster. We do not need to learn every programming language to understand how to read their code. All of them follow the same principles which R. D. Tennent initially defined:

1. The Principle of Abstraction
2. The Principle of Correspondence
3. The Principle of Data Type Completeness

# Think outside the box

Welcome to the hacker's way of thinking called: "**`Outside the box`**."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Occam's Razor

Occam's Razor, also known as the principle of parsimony, is a philosophical and scientific principle that suggests that when faced with multiple explanations or hypotheses for a given phenomenon, the simplest one should be preferred until more evidence or justification is available. In other words, it advises that unnecessary complexity should be avoided when choosing between competing explanations.

In scientific and practical contexts, Occam's Razor encourages researchers and thinkers to favor explanations that require fewer assumptions or postulations, as these are generally more elegant and easier to test or verify. However, it's important to note that Occam's Razor is not an absolute rule; it's more of a heuristic or guideline. There might be cases where a more complex explanation is warranted if it provides a significantly better fit to the available evidence.

# Talent

We all know one or two talented people in our circles of acquaintances. These are people who, in our opinion, bring incredible performance in one or another area. Most people believe such talents and abilities are innate and that these people have strong skills in these areas due to their genetics or other intangible factors. Besides the fact that genetics influence our thinking processes, talent itself is not innate—the ability to solve particular problems with excellence results from thought processes developed primarily in early childhood. Children can develop such a talent much more effortlessly than adults. This is because they have not yet developed complicated thinking and do not have complex hurdles to overcome. In other words,  <span style="color:green">children typically do not overcomplicate things like adults do</span>.

There is no precise definition of talent. Because the official definition is that talent is a natural aptitude or skill. Natural in this sense means that it exists in or is caused by nature. Nevertheless, it cannot be valid if we consider it carefully because this would have to apply to any skill.

Developing talent in childhood often depends mainly on the parents and how they encourage their children. If a child enjoys something, or at least it is presented as fun by the parents, and the child engages with it, it learns to deal with the given situation. This opens up new possibilities for the child, and new thought patterns are formed, which will be followed by the thought processes first. To understand how these thought processes develop, we would have to deal in detail with psychology and neurology, which goes far beyond this module's scope. However, the important thing is that we influence the development of our thought patterns, thought processes, and thus also our talents.

# Way of Learning

We must think "outside of the box" (is an essential part of the "hacker mindset") => seeing things out of limitations placed on us.
<p style="color:blue ; background-color:rgb(68, 118, 132) ; text-align:center ; font-weight:800 ; padding:10px ; border-radius:20px">
A problem is an emotional state. Without emotions, it is just a situation.
</p>
In other words, frustration and confusion come with the point of view we are looking at. The learning process is not just a theoretical and practical part. It is also our learning process and progress that largely depends on our `emotional state`. If we feel good and we know we will reach our goal, we will be successful.

Another essential part that makes you successful is that you `know your goal`. Imagine the following scenario:
<p style="background-color:rgb(68, 118, 132); padding:10px">
You're standing still in a room, and your instructor instructs you to move across the room, and you start moving. After a while, the instructor put a chair in your way. What will you do? - You may sit down on this chair.
</p>

Now let us change the scenario a little bit:
<p style="background-color:rgb(68, 118, 132); padding:10px">
Your instructor instructs you to move to the other corner. We start moving, and the instructor puts a chair in our way again. What will we do?  
You will pass the chair and continue moving forward to the corner because you know your goal.
</p>

The big difference between these two scenarios is that we `know our goal` and know how we have to move on. We will overcome the obstacles which are put in our way. If we do not have a goal, we will stop at the first obstacle. Without a goal, we will be disoriented moving from one topic to another.

# Learning Efficiency

It is not easy to find the information that we need. We have to find out what kind of information we are looking for :
- What do we already know ?
- What do we not know yet ?
Little scenario :
<p style="background-color:rgb(68, 118, 132); padding:10px">
Little student want to learn how to code. Before a student starts coding real projects, he starts learn many things that can minimize number of errors.
</p>
We have to fail, it's an <span style="color:green">unavoidable</span> and <span style="color:green">essential</span> part of <span style="color:green">learning</span> . This is one of parts of learning that makes us successful. "Experience is built on failures". It explains that we know how to handle differently. 

To be good at something  means  we know <span style="color:green">what we are doing</span> . If we know what we are doing ,  that means that we are experienced with this topic. Experience means we have a vast repertoire in this field. Repertoire comes from associations and practical experience. When we say "practical experience" , we want to know how much we have to become competent at specific task.

=> Rule : "10 000-Hours" by JAUSH KAUFMAN
- He proposes that we can learn something new in 20 hours, even working on it for just 45 minutes per day. This sounds much more attainable!
=> Rule : "80/20" (PARETO PRICIPLE)
- The `Pareto principle` states that with 20% of the effort, we can achieve 80% of the effect. Conversely, this means that with 80% of the effort, we can achieve the remaining 20% of the effect, which is 100% missing. However, it is essential to note that it does not apply to everything but is a general rule applied to specific areas.

# Learning type

 
![[Pasted image 20230909235515.png]] 

1.  Passive learning:
if we follow the learning pyramid while going through anything by reading only , you will learn only about 10% . By watching some demonstrations , you will learn less than 30% .

2. Active learning:
By using active learning , we collect 50% experience , by start discussion processes , results , finding with others and see different points of view and informations to compare with our own and find out what we missed.

The information has a certain level of `quality`, but not all information is helpful. More than that, some information can confuse and disorient us completely. To learn to discern such information, we need a `repertoire` which we collect `by practicing`. Therefore, it is essential to understand the context of the topic we are researching.

Moreover, it depends on our `motivation`, `focus`, and `our goal`.

There are many different ways to stay motivated. An excellent method that works very well is by recognizing success, even the most minor successes. We must recognize our successes and see that we have made progress. We already talked about how important it is to have a goal. When we know our goal, we know the direction of our actions. If we are focused on our goal, we will notice when we drift from our path. By following our path, we will automatically look back and see how far we have come. At this point, it is vital to notice the `progress` we have made.

`Progress is noticeable when the question that tortured us has lost its meaning.`

# The brain

- Our brain is always active in all regions.
- The human are intelligent because he can learn fast something.
- The brain regions that responsible for solving difficult logical tasks do not develop until we're 20 (+/-2) years old.
- One of the best-known examples is Einstein, who we know was terrible at math and learned very slowly throughout his school career, unlike the others. We also know some people who were very bad at school in one subject but are unbeatable in another.
 ---

# The will

- will is associated with conscious decisions and actions taken to achieve specific goals.
- the role of belief in one's abilities, suggesting that self-confidence can help overcome fears and obstacles.
- the fear of failure, particularly in fields like penetration testing. It suggests that many students may fear failure without fully understanding what they are afraid of, and they may give up when faced with challenging subjects. The text encourages perseverance and continuous learning as a means of achieving success.
- It is important to setting clear goals, believing in oneself, and facing challenges with determination and persistence.

---

# The Goal

- The Goal is as a future, desirable state that individuals aspire to achieve and stresses that goals should be specific and clearly defined.
- successful individuals often don't know the exact path to their goals but emphasize the importance of having a clear goal in mind. It also cautions against claiming that one's way is the only right way to achieve a goal, as there are often multiple paths to success.

---

# Decision making

- decisions are choices made from several options, influenced by both rational and emotional factors.
- consider how setting their own limitations and gathering relevant facts can make decisions more effective. It emphasizes that people should not give up on their goals just because they initially see no solution, as more data and understanding can open up new possibilities.

# Documentation

- The essential characteristics of documentation are:
1. Overview
2. Structure
3. Clarity

- There are many resources available for documentation. We recommend a tool called `CherryTree`. It is essential to get clarity, and a picture is worth a thousand words. For this, we can use a tool called `FlameShot` that makes it easier for us to take screenshots and edit them directly.

- No matter whom the documentation is intended for, here are some guidelines we can follow:
1. It is beneficial to put ourselves in the position of our readers. This will make it much easier for us to design the documentation.
2. Avoid repetition and ambiguity.
3. Make documentation as easy to read as possible. No one wants to read the documentation that is difficult to understand or follow.

# Focus

- Focus involves concentrating our thinking and attention on a chosen topic while fading out all other thoughts related to different subjects.
- The reason why physical activity, such as going to the gym after a stressful day, helps people calm down. It attributes this effect to the production of endorphins (happiness hormones) during workouts and how they reduce pain, have a calming effect, regulate sleep, affect hunger, and strengthen the immune system.
- the relationship between focus and attention, highlighting that they are not the same. Attention refers to the immediate focus on the present moment, while focus is the deliberate alignment of one's mental energy toward a specific goal. It provides an example of how distractions can hinder focus and demonstrates the importance of setting clear goals to maintain focus effectively.

---

# Attention

- Attention is the perception of a specific topic with a higher level of interest, influenced by personal factors like interests, needs, attitudes, and experiences. Attention is crucial for concentration and focus, and maintaining it on a specific topic is key to effective learning.
- the limitations of attention, as it naturally decreases over time. It suggests the importance of understanding one's attention span and emotional state, documenting these factors, and experimenting with various conditions to optimize learning.
